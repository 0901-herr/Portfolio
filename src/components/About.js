            I am a Software Developer at Monash University's eSolutions ChatBot
            team, currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence. I
            graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor's degree in
            Computer Science and have developed a strong interest in software
            development. With 1 year of experience in Full-Stack development for
            Web and Mobile Applications, gained through professional roles and
            internships, I am eager to expand my knowledge and collaborate on
            innovative ideas.
            <br />
            <br />I first discovered the magic of creating something by putting
            together LEGO blocks and have followed that path ever since.
            Purchasing my first Python textbook in secondary school opened up a
            new window to create and develop software. I aspire to one day build
            something that makes a positive impact on people's lives. But in the
            meantime when I'm free, you can find me playing basketball üèÄ or
            swimming laps! üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
